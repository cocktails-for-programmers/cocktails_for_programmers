```
- 20 mL Malibu (coconut liqueur)
- 20 mL Lychee Liqueur (a fruit)
- 40 mL Cognac or Brandy
- 150 mL Cherry juice
- Lemon
- Ice
```

**Directions:**

1.  Add basic ingredients into a high glass filled with ice.
2.  Add lemon juice to taste.
3.  Thoroughly mix until the glass is misted.
4.  Garnish with a slice of orange and a maraschino cherry.

The drink will be sweet, fragrant, and fresh. This ruby-coloured cocktail perfectly matches the Ruby logo.

### Python

This cocktail looks like a [green python](https://www.google.ru/search?q=green+python&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og). :snake:

```

### Profit!

Profit! should be sweet and airy. That's how we saw this cocktail.

<img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/962/c3f/122/962c3f12264c8baf7c00d7f5c2322905.jpg" alt="Profit!" title="Profit!"/>

```

- 20 mL Triple Sec

- Cocoa Powder
```

**Directions:**

1.  Shake together with ice and strain.
2.  Garnish with whipped cream and dust with cocoa powder (use a sifter for better results).
3.  Put a cherry on top.

This cocktail is pretty sweet with an interesting taste.

### Epic Fail

<img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/56f/3dc/235/56f3dc2353b0f845a3e8c29512f68dd7.jpg" alt="Epic Fail" title="Epic Fail" />

```
- 50 mL Vodka
- 100 mL Coke
- Juice of Half a Lemon
- Ice
```

**Directions:**

1.  Fill a glass of ice with all ingredients.
2.  Thoroughly mix till the glass is misted.
3.  Garnish with a lemon slice.

By design, the lemon and Coke conceal the taste of alcohol. But if you go too far, it will be a real epic fail. Be careful if you want to try something like this!

### Memory Leak

```

**Directions:**

2.  Add the rest of the ingredients and mix.
3.  Garnish with a slice of lime and you've got tasty and stunning drink.

### Tschunk

Tschunk is a famous Hacker cocktail that was developed around the "Chaos
Computer Club" in Berlin and is now well known to many Hackers in Europe. The combination
of alcohol and coffein (from the
[mate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(beverage)) makes it highly
vitalizing at first. But don't shoot over the [Ballmer
Peak](http://xkcd.com/323/) ;)

```
- 160mL Carbonated mate-extract (best results with Club-Mate)
- 40mL Rum (best results with Havana Añejo 3 Años)
- 1/2 Lime
- 1 tbsp. cane sugar
- Crushed ice
```

**Directions:**

1. To garnish: Sweep over the edge of the glas with a lime wedge, then wallow
   the edge in a plate of cane sugar
2. Dice the lime and fill it in the glass together with the sugar
3. Squash them with a wooden pestle
4. Fill the glas with crushed ice
5. Add the rum
6. Carefully add the carbonated mate-extract (might foam over!)
7. Carefully stir it a bit
8. Garnish with a straw and a lime slice

**Note:** [Club-Mate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate) is currently
distributed to 40 countries. If yours not in the list, there are many
alternatives, and you can even brew it yourself. All you need is 4 tsp. mate
leaves, 4 tsp. cane sugar, half a lemon and a water carbonator:

1. Boil 1L of water
2. In a small cup add suggar and lemon juice and approx. 20mL water to make it
   into a sirup
3. Add the mate leaves to the rest of the water and allow it to infuse for
   approx. 4 Minutes.
4. Cool it down, until you can safely use your water carbonator (if its still
   to hot and your carbonator is made of plastic it might melt!)
5. After carbonating the mate, add your sirup

You could also add everything right away, but the suggar and lime juice will
mess up your carbonator and it's really hard to clean afterwards!
