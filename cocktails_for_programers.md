```
- 20 mL Malibu (coconut liqueur)
- 20 mL Lychee Liqueur (a fruit)
- 40 mL Cognac or Brandy
- 150 mL Cherry juice
- Lemon
- Ice
```

**Directions:**

1.  Add basic ingredients into a high glass filled with ice.
2.  Add lemon juice to taste.
3.  Thoroughly mix until the glass is misted.
4.  Garnish with a slice of orange and a maraschino cherry.

The drink will be sweet, fragrant, and fresh. This ruby-coloured cocktail perfectly matches the Ruby logo.

### Python

This cocktail looks like a [green python](https://www.google.ru/search?q=green+python&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og). :snake:

```
- 50 mL White Rum
- 30 mL Mint Liqueur

- Sprite or 7 Up
```

**Directions:**

1.  Shake together with ice and strain.
2.  Pour into a glass and add Sprite or 7 Up.

This cocktail must be served fast - its froth dissapears quickly. This drink has a fresh pineapple taste.

- 20 mL Midori (melon liqueur) + Lime

```

**Directions:**

1.  Pour all the ingredients with a bar spoon in a high shot glass layer-by-layer.

### Profit!

Profit! should be sweet and airy. That's how we saw this cocktail.

```
- 20 mL Creamy Liqueur
- 20 mL Crème de Cassis
- 20 mL Triple Sec
- Whipped Cream
- Cocoa Powder
```

**Directions:**

1.  Shake together with ice and strain.
2.  Garnish with whipped cream and dust with cocoa powder (use a sifter for better results).
3.  Put a cherry on top.

This cocktail is pretty sweet with an interesting taste.

### Epic Fail

<img src="./images/9-epic-fail.jpg" alt="Epic Fail" title="Epic Fail" />

```
- 50 mL Vodka
- 100 mL Coke
- Juice of Half a Lemon
- Ice
```

**Directions:**

1.  Fill a glass of ice with all ingredients.
2.  Thoroughly mix till the glass is misted.
3.  Garnish with a lemon slice.

By design, the lemon and Coke conceal the taste of alcohol. But if you go too far, it will be a real epic fail. Be careful if you want to try something like this!

### Memory Leak

```

**Directions:**

1.  Fill a glass with ice and small pieces of lime.
2.  Add the rest of the ingredients and mix.
3.  Garnish with a slice of lime and you've got tasty and stunning drink.
